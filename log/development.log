There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead. If you happen to draw all your beasts before Kathrena, you can still try to stick one on board and play Dire Frenzy to shuffle copies back into your deck. Combined with multiple copies of Kathrena/Cube from Stitched Tracker, you could outvalue even taunt-heavy control decks. Sometimes you can win even by tempoing out a cube on a 3/3 wolf. Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck. Of the three legendaries in the deck, this is the only non-essential one, but you'll lose a lot of power without it.

It's not a hyperoptimized meta deck, but I have a >50% winrate so far and it's a blast to play! Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/K4qoydjdTiXTD7x96Erg9B to see how I kill cubelock with this deck. There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead. If you happen to draw all your beasts before Kathrena, you can still try to stick one on board and play Dire Frenzy to shuffle copies back into your deck. Combined with multiple copies of Kathrena/Cube from Stitched Tracker, you could outvalue even taunt-heavy control decks. Sometimes you can win even by tempoing out a cube on a 3/3 wolf. Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck. Of the three legendaries in the deck, this is the only non-essential one, but you'll lose a lot of power without it.

Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck.

There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead.

It's not a hyperoptimized meta deck, but I have a >50% winrate so far and it's a blast to play! Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/K4qoydjdTiXTD7x96Erg9B to see how I kill cubelock with this deck. There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead. If you happen to draw all your beasts before Kathrena, you can still try to stick one on board and play Dire Frenzy to shuffle copies back into your deck. Combined with multiple copies of Kathrena/Cube from Stitched Tracker, you could outvalue even taunt-heavy control decks. Sometimes you can win even by tempoing out a cube on a 3/3 wolf. Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck. Of the three legendaries in the deck, this is the only non-essential one, but you'll lose a lot of power without it.

It's not a hyperoptimized meta deck, but I have a >50% winrate so far and it's a blast to play! Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/K4qoydjdTiXTD7x96Erg9B to see how I kill cubelock with this deck. There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead. If you happen to draw all your beasts before Kathrena, you can still try to stick one on board and play Dire Frenzy to shuffle copies back into your deck. Combined with multiple copies of Kathrena/Cube from Stitched Tracker, you could outvalue even taunt-heavy control decks. Sometimes you can win even by tempoing out a cube on a 3/3 wolf. Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck. Of the three legendaries in the deck, this is the only non-essential one, but you'll lose a lot of power without it. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/SLedM5fgpfgzKYQKjr3jo7 to see how I chewed through a control warlock's voidwalls and killed him with Deathstalker value.", "channel_id"=>"5"}, "commit"=>"Create Discussion"}

There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead. If you happen to draw all your beasts before Kathrena, you can still try to stick one on board and play Dire Frenzy to shuffle copies back into your deck. Combined with multiple copies of Kathrena/Cube from Stitched Tracker, you could outvalue even taunt-heavy control decks. Sometimes you can win even by tempoing out a cube on a 3/3 wolf. Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck. Of the three legendaries in the deck, this is the only non-essential one, but you'll lose a lot of power without it.

It's not a hyperoptimized meta deck, but I have a >50% winrate so far and it's a blast to play! Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/K4qoydjdTiXTD7x96Erg9B to see how I kill cubelock with this deck. There are several win conditions, which I list below, but the main (and the most fun) one is the first - \r\n\r\n1) Kathreena-Carnivorous Cube-Play Dead : You survive till turn 7/8 while drawing your Kathrena or discovering a copy using Stitched Tracker, and not drawing more than one of your three beasts (King Krush/2x Charged Devilsaurs). You then play your Kathrena, recruiting a charging dinosaur - you can either go face with it for 7/8 damage or control the board. Next turn either your dino survives, or you get your Kathrena killed summoning another dino, or you Play Dead on Kathrena to summon another. You charge face with it, then Cube it, and then Play Dead on the Cube to get two more charging dinos, for a total of 21-24 damage in one turn, plus 6 from Kathrena if you didn't have to kill her. Two Play Deads on the cube makes for a total of 35-40 damage for 7 mana. Even if you don't OTK your opponent, you have probably demolished their board and if they play a board clear then your cube dies producing 2 more dinos.\r\n\r\nThe combo scales well even whenwhen don't draw everything in perfect order - you can already pull off powerful swing turns with just Kathrena+Play Dead. If you happen to draw all your beasts before Kathrena, you can still try to stick one on board and play Dire Frenzy to shuffle copies back into your deck. Combined with multiple copies of Kathrena/Cube from Stitched Tracker, you could outvalue even taunt-heavy control decks. Sometimes you can win even by tempoing out a cube on a 3/3 wolf. Terrorscale Stalker can be added to make cubing more consistent, but hurts the consistency of discovering Kathrena with Stitched Tracker.\r\n\r\n2) Secrets+Spellstone : The deck runs 6 secrets to control the board early game, so if you draw an early Spellstone you can have 12/12 of stats out on turn 4/5. This can win you the game against classes that don't have good AoE like rogue and hunter. The secrets list is Explosive Trap for flood decks, Wandering Monster to get on board early and Freezing Trap to protect your board or disrupt strong tempo plays like Possessed Lackey. You could try other secrets like Snake Trap - there's an advantage to playing more kinds of secrets because you can't play two of one at the same time. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/LfHvGPQprEAeHjV5iXTNbE for an example of me demolishing rogue with Spellstones.\r\n\r\n3) Deathstalker Rexxar : This card is unbelievable, the most interesting DK and possibly the most powerful. It gives hunters exactly the two things they need - the battlecry gives you AoE which can be a huge swing against wide boards, and the hero power gives you card draw - better even than drawing from your deck, because you get to draw insane OP minions customized to your situation. With the expanded beast pool including everything from rush, poisonous and lifesteal, you can draw into amazing control tools and outvalue almost any deck. Of the three legendaries in the deck, this is the only non-essential one, but you'll lose a lot of power without it. Check out https://hsreplay.net/replay/SLedM5fgpfgzKYQKjr3jo7 to see how I chewed through a control warlock's voidwalls and killed him with Deathstalker value."], ["created_at", "2018-04-26 04:39:51.662609"], ["updated_at", "2018-04-26 04:39:51.662609"], ["user_id", 2], ["channel_id", 8]]
